General Overview and Explanation:
The video streaming industry is growing rapidly, with revenue expected to surpass $146 billion annually by 2028. This growth has led to the rise of numerous paid over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms competing with established services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. According to research by Omdia, the most popular streaming service in South Africa is Netflix, with roughly 1.31 million local subscribers by late 2023. Additionally, binge-watching is a common behaviour among South Africans, with 62.20% of participants frequently binge-watching TV shows, particularly those with home Wi-Fi. This trend highlights the need for escapism and relaxation, as many prefer spending their leisure time indulging in their favourite TV content online. Younger demographics, particularly those aged 18 to 24 and 35 to 45, show a strong preference for online streaming. This indicates that Millennials and younger audiences are driving the future of TV consumption in South Africa.
