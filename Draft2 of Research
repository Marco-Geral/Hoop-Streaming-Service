Current Market Trends
The video streaming industry is experiencing significant growth, with revenue expected to surpass $146 billion annually by 2028. This growth has led to an influx of paid over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms aiming to compete with established services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. While some ventures, such as Quibi, have failed, others have successfully carved out niches. For instance, Crunchyroll, a dedicated anime streaming service, saw substantial growth during the pandemic and now boasts over 5 million paying subscribers.

Disney+ exemplifies the success of leveraging a deep content library combined with new programming. Launched in November 2019, Disney+ quickly gained over 50 million subscribers within five months, and its subscriber base has since grown to over 157 million. This demonstrates the potential for new entrants to capture significant market share quickly, provided they offer compelling content.

Key Players in the Market
The major players in the streaming market include:

Netflix: Continues to lead with a vast library of original and licensed content.
Netflix, the most popular video streaming service in South Africa, was estimated to have roughly 1.31 million local subscribers by late 2023, according to research by Omdia.
Overall, Netflix’s top 10 movie and TV show rankings consisted of titles from a much wider range of genres than the top 10 most-watched programmes on South African TV in February 2024, including crime dramas, documentaries, reality programming, standup comedy, scripted comedy, children’s content, and thrillers.
Amazon Prime Video: Offers a wide variety of movies, TV shows, and exclusive content.
Disney+: Capitalizes on Disney's extensive catalog and new hit shows like "The Mandalorian."
Hulu: Known for its diverse content, including current TV shows, movies, and original programming.
These platforms provide cross-platform compatibility, catering to modern consumers' preferences for accessing content on multiple devices.

Impact of Streaming on Traditional Media
The rise of streaming services has significantly impacted traditional media. Many major media companies have shifted towards direct-to-consumer (D2C) strategies, retracting content from third-party platforms like Netflix to promote their own streaming services. Disney's transition to a D2C model with Disney+ is a prime example, which led to many other media houses following suit.

Economic factors, such as inflation, also play a role in media consumption trends. Rising costs of living have led to a high churn rate in streaming subscriptions, with a record 32 million U.S. consumers canceling their services in the third quarter of 2022 alone. This indicates that while streaming services are popular, they are also viewed as expendable luxuries during economic downturns.


2.	Audience Preferences
Demographic Insights and Viewing behaviours:
A recent study titled "Over-The-Top Television Services and Changes in Consumer Viewing Patterns in South Africa" by Robertson K. Tengeh and Nokuphiwa Udoakpan reveals a clear preference for online streaming over traditional linear TV among South Africans, particularly among young adults and males. Notably, individuals aged 18 to 24 overwhelmingly favour streaming, with a significant portion of males in this age group choosing it over linear TV. The study also highlights that 23.8% of the respondents, especially males aged 35 to 45, spend more than five hours daily consuming TV content online. This trend indicates a strong shift towards online TV consumption, facilitated by the convenience of accessing content on various devices.

Binge-watching is a common behaviour among South Africans, with 62.20% of the participants reporting that they frequently binge-watch TV shows, a trend prevalent across all age groups, especially among those with home Wi-Fi. This behaviour underscores the need for escapism and relaxation after a stressful day, as many respondents indicated a preference for spending their leisure time indulging in their favourite TV content online.

The study suggests that as broadband data becomes faster and more affordable, and as smart TVs, smartphones, and other streaming devices become cheaper, this shift towards online streaming will continue to grow. However, there is a concern about the sustainability of this trend. The binge-watching phenomenon could lead to OTT TV service operators struggling to keep up with the demand for fresh content.

In terms of demographic specifics, young adults aged 18 to 24 (n=34) and those aged 35 to 45 (n=32) showed a strong preference for streaming. In contrast, only a small number of individuals aged 55 and above (n=7) preferred streaming over traditional TV. Additionally, a significant number of male respondents (n=77) indicated a preference for streaming. These findings illustrate that Millennials and younger demographics are driving the future of TV consumption in South Africa, where the majority of the population falls within these age groups.
