Functionality needed for Admin:

Update Show, Add Show, Delete Show 

Idea: Admins have access to an extra page of the website where they can choose to update or delete a show based on the show title. or to add an entirely new show.

Update Show: 
Required Fields: Title of show ('title')
they can choose to update any or all of the following fields:
title, director, rating, actors (this will simply add new actors), genre (this will also just add another genre), description, studio, duration (if we're adding that?),  image url.
suggestion: provide a space for them to add the title of the show to be updated and another section where they can add the new values for each field. If they don't add any content in this second field, return an error.

*NOTE: "Show" in this case refers to a movie or a tv show
		"action" is used by the API to determine which function to call and is added in js

*Suggestion/Question to all: Should we add functionality for the admins to delete reviews or am i making work where we don't need it?
