To Chisom for the javascript:

1.Header.php:

Implement the search button to search from the database. I've added basic script to the html just for the drop down and search button functionality.

Replace the images with the images from the api.

2.Profile page:
 I've added the option for a user to edit their information. So when they make a change the database should be modified.

There is a remove from favourites button that needs to be implemented.

Dynamically create the favourites list based on what the user favourited in the view page. The structure is the same as the homepage, however there is html code with comments to guide you.

"Continue watching" list can be random items but would also need to be created dynamically. If this will be too complicated or time consuming, the profile page can just have the bio and the favourites list.

3.Home page:
Create dynamic html page to display image, title, rating (Don't need the time thing) I added comments to show the structure of the html.The structure is the same for every other movie and every tv show.


Allow users to click on the image and view the movie/ show where the view page will be displayed. I didn't include a navbar tab for view page. I assumed it will "pop up" or something like that. Lusanda can explain how he wanted that implemented.


4.Login page and register page:
Button functionality to login and register

5.Nothing needed for the header and footer.

Whatever else I missed or feel like needs to be implemented, feel free to do so.






To Saber and Marco for the PHP:

1. Login page:
Email address
Password
Remember me checkbox ( I suppose we don't need to implement this, but if there's time at the end, it would be cool)

2. Register page:
Name
Surname
Email
Phone number
Password

3. Profile page:
user name, phone number, phone number to put in their bio and allow user to edit their bio
user favourites
I added a "continue watching" list as well. This can be random movies.

4. Home page:
Retrieving movies/ tv shows, their respective titles and rating
We also need a description for the "new releases " carousel HOWEVER, if the descriptions from the api are too long, then we don't need to include the description in the carousel
