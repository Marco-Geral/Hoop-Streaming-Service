This is for the tvshows and movies pages.

-Fix JS for filter. The filters are buttons titled by genre (you can only filter by genre). When a filter button is clicked, for example "Comedy", the row containing all comedy movies should be shown and all other rows should be hidden. Rows are differentiated by tags in their row divs. For example in the row div which contains all the comedy movies you will find: <div class="row" data-genre="comedy">. The JS code for this filter has already been implemented but I couldn't get it working for some reason... the code is very readable and understandable so you wont have a problem seeing the logic and what I was trying to do. The code functions by just hiding all rows that don't say "Comedy" or whatever filter button was clicked. 

-Implement search for tv shows and movies (NOTE: the tv shows and movies page both reference the same js file movies.js). I think being able to search by title name is sufficient, you can add being able to search by director names if you'd like to.
